# Text-Steganography-by-Changing-Words-Spelling
One of the important issues in security fields is hidden exchange of information. There are different methods for this purpose such as cryptography and steganography. Steganography is a method of hiding data within a cover media so that other individuals fail to realize their existence. In this paper a new method for steganography in English texts is proposed. In this method the US and UK spellings of words substituted in order to hide data in an English text. For example "color" has different spelling in UK (colour) and US (color). Therefore the data can be hidden in the text by substituting these words.
